As a capstone requirement for my graduate program, all students were required to complete an original research project analyzing a data set incorporating multiple measures and time points. For my project, I explored associations between reported measures of social position and depressive symptoms among adolescents using data from Waves I and II the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent to Adult Health. I used Stata to run my analysis. 
This repository contains my code files. Visit https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/data/#public-use for instructions on how to download Waves I and II of Data, then start with WorkflowNoSyntax.do to follow my workflow.
